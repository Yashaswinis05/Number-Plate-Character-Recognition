Number plate Character Recognition is the process of detecting the position of a number plate and then using the Optical Character Recognition technique to identify the text on the plate. This process is widely used in real-life scenarios where accuracy is important.

Following are the steps involved in the process of implementing Number plate Character Recognition with Python.

 Required dependencies.
Read the image. apply filters like grayscale and blur.
Perform edge detection.
Find contours and apply mark to separate out actual number plate.
Extract text from images using OCR.
Render Result.
